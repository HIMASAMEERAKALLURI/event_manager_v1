# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

This assignment has been an enriching experience, introducing me to various new concepts such as issue creation, collaboration, and the process of closing issues. While the journey was challenging, one aspect stood out as particularly troublesome for me: the process of closing issues.

During the experimentation phase of closing issues, I encountered a major setback when my branch became corrupted on the last day of submission. This was a daunting challenge to overcome. To resolve the issue, I attempted to pull and perform pytest, but encountered errors that impeded progress. Faced with this obstacle, I made the decision to delete the repository and create a new fork, starting the process anew.

Despite the setbacks, I believe this experience has been invaluable for my growth as a developer. It has highlighted the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. There is still much to learn, but I am eager to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in software development.
